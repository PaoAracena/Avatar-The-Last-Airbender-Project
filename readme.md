Welcome to the avatar nation !

Avatar the last air-bender is one of my favorite shows so i decided to create my website based on it.

My main pag shows a small description on what the show is and a clip of one of my favorite scences.

if you click where is says "ALL KNOW AVATARS" it will take you to my second page. On this page you can see a short desciption of the avatar cycle and a youtude video link. On the top right you can click on the dropdown to see more inforamtion about different avatars.

to go back to the home screen, click "Home Page" on the top left

Once you're back on the main page you can click on "CHARACTERS" you can see a decription of some of the characters on the show. To find more infomation you can click on the dropdown bar and click on any character.

Thank you for taking the time to look into my project <3
